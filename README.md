# **A Little Introduction for Pokegirl Gamer**

**Pokegirl Gamer** is a *Mod maker & a Content Creator.* She’s focusing on making mods for Windows and most especially Mobile. She once was a stardew mobile player, she loves playing stardew valley with mods but the saddening part is there are no mod makers interested on making mods for mobile (If there is, they’re not into it). She thought of giving attention to the mobile players and hear their requests so they can be on trend when it comes to modding. Now she’s asking for the support to continue making mods for stardew valley mobile players, **HELP HER OUT AND SPREAD THIS NEWS TO THE MOBILE PLAYERS!**
